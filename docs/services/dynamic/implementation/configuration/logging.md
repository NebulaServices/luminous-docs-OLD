# Developer console logging 
// 0: none, 1: errors, 2: errors + warnings, 3: errors + warnings + info
Dynamic gives you the option to choose what kind of logs are allowed to appear in the Developer console found in the inspect element menu. 

## No logging 
For absolutely no logging, change the value in your configuration to `0`

## Errors only 
If you only want errors in console, but want to ignore warnings, this is the level for you! Turn the value in your configuration to `1`

## Indecisive
Looking for both Errors and Warnings? Change the value in your configuration to `2`

## The everything burger 
Exactly what it sounds like, errors + warnings + info. Set the value in your configuration to `2`
